Shopify Expert Mat Mullen shares his pre launch checklist in this exclusive extract from [Grow Vol. 1](http://shopify.com/grow)


#The List

- [ ] **1. Primary Domain**

First off, has the primary domain already been added to the site? If not, I need to make sure my client sends over their registrar info so I can easily login when the time is right and add the CNAME and A Records.

- [ ] **2. Quality Assurance**

Next, it’s time to QA the site to make sure that all the media queries are working and the site looks good on an iPad and iPhone. 

- [ ] **3. Links**

If you’re building a new theme on top of an existing Shopify store, you’ll want to make sure all the navigation links are pointing to the proper places. 

- [ ] **4. Update Templates**

Sometimes when I’m building a site, I’ll create custom page templates which don’t automatically get applied when the theme is published. 

- [ ] **5. Test Transaction**

Don’t forget to do a test transaction to make sure everything is working as planned with accepting payments and confirmation emails. 

- [ ] **6. Email Notifications**

The default email styles for the Shopify confirmation emails are pretty bland, so I like to use the free Email Template Creator app to create better looking templates that are on brand with the store.

- [ ] **7. Dropbox**

Once the store has launched, I always make a point of exporting the finished theme and saving it to a Dropbox folder just in case something happens to it down the line. 

- [ ] **8. Check Proposal**

Last but not least, I look through the original proposal that I sent over to make sure everything we discussed has been completed. 


- [ ] **9. After Sales**

An important thing that I try not to forget is that my business has grown because of the positive reviews I’ve received. To make sure my clients are happy at the end of the project, I always try to make a point of making sure every client feels empowered to update their own site once it launches.
